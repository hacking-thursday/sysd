Description: the daemon who supplies firsthand system data
 sysd is an open source project to supply the system data with HTTP API in a
 lightweight daemon.
 .
 sysd implements a light dependeny daemon in golang, and provides /proc,/sys the
 firsthand system data in json/xml/... common formats with a high-level RESTful
 HTTP API. With sysd, application and plugin developers are able to save their
 works from parsing variant output from low-level unix command tools, and
 dependencies.
